# IRIS Flower Classification

## Project Overview

This project aims to classify different species of IRIS flowers using machine learning algorithms. The dataset contains measurements of various features of IRIS flowers, and the goal is to predict the species based on these measurements.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project can be found [here](https://github.com/SakshamTapadia/CODSOFT/blob/main/Task3%20-%20DataSet.csv). It contains the following columns:

- **SepalLengthCm**: Sepal length in centimeters
- **SepalWidthCm**: Sepal width in centimeters
- **PetalLengthCm**: Petal length in centimeters
- **PetalWidthCm**: Petal width in centimeters
- **Species**: Species of the IRIS flower (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica)

## Project Notebook

The complete project notebook is available [here](https://github.com/SakshamTapadia/CODSOFT/blob/main/Task3%20-IRIS%20Flower%20Classification.ipynb). It includes the following steps:

1. **Data Exploration and Preprocessing**:
    - Load and inspect the dataset.
    - Handle missing values (if any).
    - Encode categorical variables.
    - Feature scaling and normalization.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
    - Visualize the distribution of features.
    - Analyze the correlation between features and species.

3. **Model Building**:
    - Split the data into training and testing sets.
    - Train multiple machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM, KNN).
    - Evaluate model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

4. **Model Evaluation and Selection**:
    - Compare the performance of different models.
    - Select the best model based on evaluation metrics.

5. **Prediction and Conclusion**:
    - Make predictions on the test set.
    - Summarize the findings and conclusion.

## Results

The results of the model evaluation and the final predictions on the test set are included in the project notebook. The best performing model achieved high accuracy and provided insights into the most important features influencing the classification of IRIS flower species.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the application of machine learning techniques to classify IRIS flower species based on various features. By leveraging data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and model evaluation, we can build accurate predictive models and gain valuable insights into the classification problem.
